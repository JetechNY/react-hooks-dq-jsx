# Discussion Questions: Declarative Programming and JSX

The starter code for this project is in two HTML files. You won't typically
write React straight into an HTML file, but we've set this lab up like this to
demonstrate some similarities/differences between working with React and working
with vanilla JavaScript.

For those who are curious, the three scripts loaded in the `<head>` tag of the
`index-react.html` file are what allow us to load in React and Babel, and write
JSX in the `<script type="text/babel">` tag below!

### Declarative Programming

In this repository is an `index.html` file with some pre-written HTML. Open this
file in your browser and discuss the following:

1. Looking at the page in the browser, discuss which parts of the page look
   repeatable. Now looking at the HTML, discuss which bits of the HTML are
   repeatable.
2. If you were to abstract out the repeatable sections, which bits would remain
   static and which would need to be dynamic? In other words, which parts of the
   HTML are always the same (static) and which parts are unique to each section
   (dynamic)?

ex:

```HTML
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h1>Goodbye!</h1>
<h1>Whoa!</h1>

<!-- h1 tag is static, exclamation point is static, the greeting is dynamic, so the abstracted version might look like... -->

<h1><!-- INSERT GREETING HERE -->!</h1>
```

3. Eventually real data will be used in this application. Considering that you
   have many repeating sections of your page and that each section has various
   **properties** which need to be filled in, how might your data be structured?

ex:

```html
<!-- If your abstracted component looks like this:  -->
<h1><!-- INSERT GREETING HERE -->!</h1>

<!-- and your desired HTML looks like: -->
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h1>Goodbye!</h1>
<h1>Whoa!</h1>
```

```js
// then you might need an array that looks like this:
let greetings = [
  { phrase: "Hello" },
  { phrase: "Goodbye" },
  { phrase: "Whoa" },
];
// at a minumum, each h1 needs to know what phrase to print as a greeting
```

### JSX

There is another file in this repository called `index-react.html` with some
pre-written HTML and JSX that, in the browser, looks identical. Open this file
in the browser as well, and discuss the following:

4. What is different about the pure HTML written in `index.html` and the mix of
   HTML and JSX written in `index-react.html`? What is the same?

5. Try writing your own component using JSX to create the abstracted HTML you
   created in step 2.

ex:

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>{props.phrase}!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <Greeting phrase="Hello" />
    <Greeting phrase="Goodbye" />
    <Greeting phrase="Whoa" />
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

6. Using the array you created in step 3, try to operate on that array to
   programmatically create your JSX

ex:

```jsx
let greetings = [
  { phrase: "Hello" },
  { phrase: "Goodbye" },
  { phrase: "Whoa" },
];

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>{props.phrase}!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    {greetings.map((greeting) => (
      <Greeting phrase={greeting.phrase} />
    ))}
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

**Note**: JSX can render not only individual JSX elements, but _arrays_ of JSX
elements as well. Consider the above call to `greetings.map`: `map` will return
an array containing `Greeting` components. These components will render in that
order.

7. If you got through step 6, try adding additional rows of data to your array.
   What happens in the browser? What is the correlation between the data and the
   DOM? Given this correlation, what would be an easy way to add, remove, or
   update information on the DOM?
